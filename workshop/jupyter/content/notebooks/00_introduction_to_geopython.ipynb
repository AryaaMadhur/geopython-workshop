    "Welcome to the GeoPython workshop. \n",
    "This workshop should give you a brief overview about how to use Python when working \n",
    "with geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will use Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "As the installation of all dependencies on all platforms (Win, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "can be quite involved we have contained Jupyter and all dependencies within a Docker Image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the various geospatial web services like pygeoapi and pycsw, are provided by Docker Images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The main requirement is to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You may optionally install [QGIS](http://qgis.org) as a GIS data viewer. \n",
    "QGIS is a multiplatform open source desktop application for geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are located in each directory, so you should be able to access \n",
    "them by using `./data/file.xyz` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ouput data\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs should be located in `/data/` directory.\n"
