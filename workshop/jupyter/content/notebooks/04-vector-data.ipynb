    "Vector data is spatial data, generally consisting of two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Geometry\n",
    "* Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometries** are the *Points, Lines and Polygons* as introduced in the [Geometries Lesson](02-geometry.ipynb).\n",
    "They represent the \"shape\" of the real-world phenomenon. \n",
    "**Attribute** data is information appended to the Geometry (or the other way around) \n",
    "usually in tabular format (\"records\"). Together, this combination Geometry+Attributes \n",
    "is often called a (Spatial) **Feature**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Vector data formats\n",
    "There are currently [over 100 vector data formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html) used for storage, e.g. files, and for data transfer.\n",
    "The most common formats are presented below. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html) is a GDAL/OGR commandline utility\n",

    "### ESRI Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "[ESRI Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) is a file-based format. It consists of at least 3 files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* .shp containing geometry\n",
    "* .shx containing index\n",
    "* .dbf attribute table\n",
    "\n",
    "The ESRI Shapefile is one of the oldest formats, some even call it a [Curse in Geoinformatics](https://www.slideshare.net/jachym/switch-from-shapefile), and is more and more replaced by GeoPackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoPackage\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) is a relatively new but promising spatial data format based on [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org).\n",
    "\n",

    "* tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales\n",
    "* attributes (non-spatial data)\n",
    "* extensions\n",

    "### GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) is a simple JSON-based format to encode vector Features. \n",
