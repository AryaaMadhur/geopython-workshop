    "# Spatial Reference Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDAL/OGR Python API library includes a dedicated module to handle Spatial Reference Systems (SRS): [osgeo.osr](https://gdal.org/python/osgeo.osr-pysrc.html). This module makes it rather simple to parametrise SRSs and transform coordinates between.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form a SRS is composed by two elements:\n",
    " 1. *Datum* - a sphere or ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth, positioned relative to the later. \n",
    " 2. *Cartographic Projection* - a set of mathematical functions that translate locations in the surface of the *datum* into the Cartesian plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WGS84 is standard *datum* issued by the World Geodetic Survey that is in wide use today. Most GPS or GNSS recievers today report geographic coordinates (e.g. longitude and latitude) in reference to this *datum*. For global cartography the WGS84 is an obvious choice, but for local mapping a bespoke *datum* can be more suitable. Most national surveys have defined *data* that suit appropriatly their country or region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Marinus of Tyre and Mercator projections are the most popular today, however, none of them is suited for either local or global cartography (appart from navigation applications in the case of Mercator). It is always useful to spend some time identifying the most appropriate projection for the work at hand. Cartagraphic projections introduce errors as they flaten the curved surface of the Earth onto a plane. A balance must be struck between the accuracy of areas, shapes and angles. For global mapping, projections like [Mollweide's Homolographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollweide_projection), [Eckert IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert_IV_projection) or [Goode's Homolosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goode_homolosine_projection) present interesting compromises. For local mapping, the [Stereographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection#Applications_to_other_disciplines), [Lambert's Azimutal Equal-Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_azimuthal_equal-area_projection) and [Gauss-Krüger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection#Ellipsoidal_transverse_Mercator) are popular choices, but many more exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [PROJ](https://proj.org) library is a cornerstone of FOSS4G that implements a large number of cartographic projections. GDAL supports most of the projections implemented by PROJ, therefore they are also available to the `osgeo.osr` module. The list of [cartographic projections implemented by PROJ](https://proj.org/operations/projections/index.html) is a good place to start exploring the different characteristic of each projection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always keep in mind one thing: no cartographic projection is not able to preserve distances correctly. Therefore avoid computing distances in the Cartesian plane, as they will be wrong. In small areas the error might be negligible, but at global or continental scales, even for large countries like Russia, distances computed on the Cartesian plane are significantly off. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new Spatial Reference object\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `osr` module the concept of SRS is encapsulated in the `SpatialReference` class. A SRS can be parametrised with an object of this class in different ways. The simplest is possibly using a [PROJ string](https://proj.org/usage/quickstart.html), a synthetic and expressive set of parameters in a character string. This is made through the `ImportFromProj4`method:"

    "The [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/European_Petroleum_Survey_Group) was a scientific body supporting the Petroluem & Gas industry in Europe.

The EPSG assigned a unique numerical identifier to each entry in its database, which became rather handy to quickly refer to a specific, well defined, SRS. Most FOSS4G support the EPSG identifiers as quick reference (some even enforce it). PROJ and GDAL are no exceptions, and therefore `SpatialReference` objects can too be initialised with an EPSG identifier:"
