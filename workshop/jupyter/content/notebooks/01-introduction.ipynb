    "# Doing Geospatial in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "![GeoPython logo](images/geopython-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a low barrier to entry and large ecosystem of tools and libraries,\n",
    "[Python](https://python.org) is the lingua franca for geospatial development.\n",
    "Whether you are doing data acquisition, processing, publishing, integration or\n",
    "analysis, there are no shortage of solid Python tools to assist in your\n",
    "daily workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will provide an introduction to performing common GIS/geospatial\n",
    "tasks using Python geospatial tools such as OWSLib, Shapely, Fiona/Rasterio,\n",
    "and common geospatial libraries like GDAL, PROJ, pycsw, as well as other tools\n",
    "from the geopython toolchain. Manipulate vector/raster data using Shapely,\n",
    "Fiona and Rasterio. Publish data and metadata to OGC web services usingx\n",
    "pygeoapi, pygeometa, pycsw, and more. Visualize your data on a map using\n",
    "Jupyter and Folium. Plus a few extras in between!\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is provided using the Jupyter Notebook environment with Python 3.\n",

    "Welcome to the GeoPython workshop. \n",
    "This workshop should give you a brief overview about how to use Python when working \n",
    "with geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will use Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "As the installation of all dependencies on all platforms (Win, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "can be quite involved we have contained Jupyter and all dependencies within a Docker Image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the various geospatial web services like pygeoapi and pycsw, are provided by Docker Images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The main requirement is to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You may optionally install [QGIS](https://qgis.org) as a GIS data viewer. \n",
    "QGIS is a multiplatform open source desktop application for geospatial data.\n",

    "### Input data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are located in each directory, so you should be able to access \n",
    "them by using `./data/file.xyz` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ouput data\n",
    "\n",
