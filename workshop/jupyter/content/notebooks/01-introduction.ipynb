    "\n",
    "With a low barrier to entry and large ecosystem of tools and libraries,\n",
    "[Python](https://python.org) is the lingua franca for geospatial development.\n",
    "Whether you are doing data acquisition, processing, publishing, integration or\n",
    "analysis, there are no shortage of solid Python tools to assist in your\n",
    "daily workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will provide an introduction to performing common GIS/geospatial\n",
    "tasks using Python geospatial tools such as OWSLib, Shapely, Fiona/Rasterio,\n",
    "and common geospatial libraries like GDAL, PROJ, pycsw, as well as other tools\n",
    "from the geopython toolchain. Manipulate vector/raster data using Shapely,\n",
    "Fiona and Rasterio. Publish data and metadata to OGC web services usingx\n",
    "pygeoapi, pygeometa, pycsw, and more. Visualize your data on a map using\n",
    "Jupyter and Folium. Plus a few extras in between!\n",

    "## Workshop environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).  Jupyter is\n",
    "an interactive development environment suitable for documenting and reproducing\n",
    "workflows using live code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the installation of all dependencies on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "can be quite involved and complex this workshop provides Jupyter and all dependencies\n",
    "within a [Docker](https://docker.org) image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, geospatial web services like [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io)\n",
    "and [pycsw](https://pycsw.org) in this workshop are provided by Docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The core requirement is to have [Docker](https://docker.org) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed\n",
    "on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may optionally install [QGIS](https://qgis.org) as a GIS data viewer. \n",
    "QGIS is a multiplatform open source desktop application for geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop data\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is bundled with sample data to demonstrate and facilitate the\n",
    "exercises.  Users have the ability to add their own data and update the live\n",
    "code examples and/or exercises to learn with local data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are located in each directory, so you should be able to access \n",
    "them by using `./data/file.xyz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output data\n",
    "\n",
    "Output data created from live code will be located in `/data/`.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Who doesn't like their data on a map right?  GIS software comes in many flavours and programming languages such\n",
    "as Java, C, JavaScript, Golang and many more.  So what's so special about Python for geospatial?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell: low barrier and fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely available: Python works on Windows, Mac, Linux and more\n",
    "* Minimal setup: the standard Python install provides significant functionality out of the box\n",
    "* Fast enough.  You can write a faster program in a lower level language but you can write programs faster in Python\n",
    "* Easy to read and understand\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cities = ['Toronto', 'Amsterdam', 'Athens']\n",
    "for city in cities:\n",
    "    print(city)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Easy to glue to core C/C++ tooling\n",
    "* Large ecosystem of supported packages ([Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), [GitHub](https://github.com), etc.\n",
    "* Geo-friendly: Python has the widest and most supported geospatial software presence\n",
    "  * Python bindings of core tooling (GDAL, PROJ, GEOS)\n",
    "  * Flexible higher level packages (OWSLib)\n",
    "  * Servers (PyWPS, pygeoapi, pycsw, etc.)\n",
    "  * Support in traditional desktop GIS (QGIS, GRASS, Esri)\n",
    "  * Data science (GeoPandas)"
