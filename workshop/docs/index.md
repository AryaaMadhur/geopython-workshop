# Doing Geospatial in Python

With a low barrier to entry and large ecosystem of tools and libraries,
[Python](https://python.org) is the lingua franca for geospatial development.
Whether you are doing data acquisition, processing, publishing, integration or
analysis, there are no shortage of solid Python tools to assist in your
daily workflows.

This workshop will provide an introduction to performing common GIS/geospatial
tasks using Python geospatial tools such as OWSLib, Shapely, Fiona/Rasterio,
and common geospatial libraries like GDAL, PROJ, pycsw, as well as other tools
from the geopython toolchain. Manipulate vector/raster data using Shapely,
Fiona and Rasterio. Publish data and metadata to OGC web services usingx
pygeoapi, pygeometa, pycsw, and more. Visualize your data on a map using
Jupyter and Folium. Plus a few extras in between!

The workshop is provided using the Jupyter Notebook environment with Python 3.
